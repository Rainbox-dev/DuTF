# DuTranslator

***DuTranslator* is meant to be used by non-coders** as well as coders. The goal is to make it easy for everyone to translate their tools into the language they'd like to use, and make it available to the community, so that the community can in turn improve the translations, and in the end enable anyone to use any tool into the language they're comfortable with.

Translations are saved in simple, open JSON text files and can be edited with any text editor too, but *DuTranslator* makes this process easier.

- [Creating a new translation](create.md) for an application
- [Basic use](use.md)
- [Updating an existing translation](update.md) file for a new version of the application
- [Merging](merge.md) several existing translations
- Other [tools](tools.md)
